Milestone # 2

- wrote the code to convert datasets from jpeg to hdf5. Datasets include flowers, birds, and MS-COCO (still working). Flowers and birds datasets are stored in Google Drive
Satya/ML-projects/Datasets

Hd5 file taxonomy is as follows:
split (train | dev | test )
example_name
    'name'
    'img'
    'embeddings'
    'class'
    'txt'

- started setting up the code for DCGAN (deep convolutional GAN) described here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05396 This GAN is a conditional generative adversarial network, 
since it is conditioned on text descriptions in order to generate images that correspond to the description. 
- the code contains training process, text-to-image embedding, and loss function estimator
- script to run is runtime.py with specific arguments


TODO:

1) write a script for data visualization (containing Data logger class)
2) test the model on MS-COCO dataset (it is a much bigger and heterogenous dataset)
