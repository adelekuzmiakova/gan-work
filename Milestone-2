Milestone # 2

- wrote the code to convert datasets from jpeg to hdf5. Datasets include flowers, birds, and MS-COCO (still working). Flowers and birds datasets are stored in Google Drive
Satya/ML-projects/Datasets

Hd5 file taxonomy is as follows:
split (train | dev | test )
example_name
    'name'
    'img'
    'embeddings'
    'class'
    'txt'

- set up code for DCGAN (deep convolutional GAN) described here: https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow


TODO:

1) add the model for conditional GAN - modify models.py and trainer.py
2) test the model on MS-COCO dataset
