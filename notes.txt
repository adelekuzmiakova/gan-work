## SETTING UP VIRTUAL ENV

# Create the virtual env:
virtualenv -p python3.5 .env

# Activate the virtual env:
source .env/bin/activate

# Install project-specific packages:
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# When done working:
deactivate

## GAN MODELS:

1) Pytorch implementation of GAN model described in Generative Adversarial Text to Image Synthesis paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05396)
TODO: train the model on the COCO dataset

2) Conditional GANs (CGANs) could perform better than traditional GANs. CGANs are not strictly unsupervised and we need some kind of labels for them to work, such as text encoding or a key word summarizing the text passage.

## DATASETS:
1) Birds
2) Flowers
3) MS-COCO

Note that the images have to be converted from jpeg to hdf5 format:

I uploaded hdf5 datasets to Google Drive
